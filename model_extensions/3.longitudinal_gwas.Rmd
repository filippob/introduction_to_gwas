## GWAS for longitudinal traits (a primer)

### Cox models

Let's start from Cox models.
The Cox proportional-hazards model (Cox, 1972) is essentially a regression model commonly used in medical research for investigating the association between the survival time of patients and one or more predictor variables.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
